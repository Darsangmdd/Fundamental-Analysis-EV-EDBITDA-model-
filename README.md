## Fundamental Analysis EV/EDBITDA model

#### While exploring the domain of finance, I understood the pain points in analyzing the stocks one wishes to buy after starting professional life. 

#### Hence, I decided to automate the process of analyzing a company fundamentally, i.e., analyzing a companyâ€™s Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss Statement, and Cash Flow statement. I applied the model to the top 50 stocks in the Indian stock market by market capitalization (also known as NIFTY50) to predict the growth of the stocks next year. 

#### The valuation model I used to predict the growth is known as the EV/EBITDA model. EV stands for Enterprise Value. In layman's terms, it is also known as the value one needs to pay if one decides to buy the company out. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization. Simply put, they are earnings received solely through the primary operations of a company. 

#### I used Beautiful Soup to get the necessary ratios and values following which I used data analysis and python programming to automate the process. 

#### The model measures the value of the company when compared to its earnings. This gives an investor a fair idea of how and where a company is placed among its competitors after taking its assets and liabilities into account.
